## Usage

- **FortiAnalyzer, FortiManager, and FortiWeb ELB Deployments:** 
  The `deploy.sh` script in each folder is used to automate the deployment of the respective appliance using the provided JSON templates. Ensure that the `parameters.json` file is properly configured with your environment's specifics before executing the script.

  Example:

  ```bash
  cd fortiweb_elb
  bash deploy.sh
  ```
